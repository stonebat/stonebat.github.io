# About Me
I do not want to prepare for every detail; if I tried, I'd never begin. As the saying goes, 'You don’t need to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.' Mistakes are part of the journey, but determination turns challenges into triumphs. Progress comes from taking the first step and growing through the process.
